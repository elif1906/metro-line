# Metro Line

## Overview
The Metro Line project is a part of a discrete computational structures lesson. It is implemented using C++ and includes code for modeling and managing metro line operations.

## Features
- Simulation of metro line operations
- Management of stations and routes
- Implementation of core algorithms for metro line scheduling

## Files
- **metro_line.cpp:** Main source file containing the implementation of the metro line functionalities.
- **Screenshots:** Images showing various aspects of the project.

## Getting Started
